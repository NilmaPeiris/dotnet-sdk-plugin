  Two operations are supported:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>clear</code>: The contents of the cache directories are deleted recursively.
      The executing user/group must have permission to the files in the cache directories.
      If not, an error is displayed indicating the files/folders that weren't cleared.
    </li>
    <li><code>list</code>: Displays the path to the specified cache location.</li>
  </ul>
