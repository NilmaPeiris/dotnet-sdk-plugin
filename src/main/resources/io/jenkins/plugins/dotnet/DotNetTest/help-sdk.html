<div>
  Name of a .NET SDK to use so that <code>dotnet</code> will be in the path.<br/>
  <!-- FIXME: It would be good to be able to import Messages.DotNet.DefaultSDK here.  -->
  If the default is specified, you either need to use the <q>With .NET</q>> element to specify one, or ensure this step runs on a
  node that has a .NET SDK installed and in the path.
